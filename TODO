- Add functionality to source machine-local files to relevant files (.bashrc
  and .vimrc, definitely. Probably a few more as well).
- Use github.com/josephwecker/bashrc_dispatch to handle various kinds of login
  (most notably, move the stty command from .bashrc to interactive-only).
- Add more dotfiles
    - irssi config? (but that might have passwords in it). Hmm...
- Make sure repo and various machines are (more or less) in sync
- Dry-run functionality?
